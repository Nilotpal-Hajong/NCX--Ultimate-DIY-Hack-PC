# NCX--Ultimate-DIY-Hack-PC

Welcome to the NCX Project — a fully modular, upgradeable, open-source PC framework built for makers, recyclers, and tech DIY enthusiasts.

---
**Modular, multi-core, hacker-grade cyberdeck** built from scratch.  
Inspired by curiosity, upgraded with imagination, and designed through AI-powered planning with ChatGPT.

## 🧠 Vision
Create a personal computer that evolves — just like its creator. Modular, upgradable, flexible.  
A machine that doesn't fail as a whole, but improves part-by-part.

## ⚙️ Core Features
- Multiple Raspberry Pi modules
- Multi-display support (main + Pi display)
- Swappable components (skeleton, panels, power units)
- Built-in SSD network storage
- Rotary encoder control system (power, brightness, volume, etc.)
- Hacker-grade portability with upgrade options

## 🔧 Progress Highlights
- ✅ First display + wiring done
- ✅ Hinges built using steel hacksaw blades
- 🔄 Working on: Final skeleton V1.0
- 🔄 Documenting GPT conversations and sketches
